# 🏠 Local Database + Gmail SMTP Setup Guide

## 📋 **Overview**

Your Family Bookkeeping Flutter app now works **completely offline** with local SQLite database and Gmail SMTP for email functionality. **No backend server required!**

## 🏗️ **Architecture**

### **Local-Only Components:**
- ✅ **SQLite Database**: All data stored locally on device
- ✅ **Gmail SMTP**: Email reports sent via family's Gmail account
- ✅ **Local Authentication**: User accounts stored in local database
- ✅ **Offline-First**: Works without internet connection
- ✅ **Family-Specific**: Each family uses their own Gmail credentials

## 🚀 **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Gmail App Password Setup**

Each family needs to set up Gmail App Passwords:

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on Gmail account
2. **Generate App Password**:
   - Go to Google Account Settings
   - Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords
   - Generate password for "Family Bookkeeping App"
   - **Save this password** - you'll need it for the app

### **2. Family Registration**

When setting up the app for the first time:

1. **Create Family Account**:
   - Enter family name
   - Admin email and password
   - Gmail credentials (email + app password)

2. **Add Family Members**:
   - Add each family member
   - Set their email addresses
   - Configure who receives reports

### **3. Email Configuration**

The app will use the family's Gmail account to send:
- 📊 **Monthly Reports**: PDF reports with family statistics
- 📧 **Expense Notifications**: Real-time notifications for new expenses
- 📅 **Weekly Summaries**: Weekly activity summaries
- 📈 **Custom Reports**: On-demand family reports

## 📊 **Data Storage**
