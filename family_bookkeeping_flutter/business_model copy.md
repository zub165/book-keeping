## 🔒 **Family Sharing & Licensing**

### **Technical Implementation:**

#### **Family Group Creation:**
```dart
class FamilyGroup {
  String id;
  String name;
  String ownerId;
  List<String> memberIds;
  SubscriptionPlan plan;
  DateTime createdAt;
  Map<String, String> permissions; // memberId -> role
}
```

#### **Permission Levels:**
```dart
enum FamilyRole {
  owner,    // Full access, billing, member management
  admin,    // Full data access, can invite members
  member,   // Can add/edit own data, view family reports
  viewer,   // Can only view family reports
  child,    // Limited access, parental controls
}
```

#### **Subscription Sharing Logic:**
```dart
// Only the family owner pays
// All members get access based on the owner's plan
// If owner downgrades, all members lose premium features
// If owner cancels, family reverts to free tier
```

### **Business Rules:**

#### **Family Creation:**
1. **Free User:** Can create family, but limited to 2 members
2. **Premium User:** Can create family with up to 3 members
3. **Family Pack User:** Can create family with up to 6 members
4. **Only one person pays** - the family owner/creator

#### **Member Invitations:**
1. **Free members** can join any family (but limited features)
2. **Premium members** can join and get full access
3. **Family members** inherit the owner's plan level
4. **Maximum 1 family per user** (prevents abuse)

#### **Billing & Ownership:**
1. **Only the family owner is charged**
2. **If owner cancels, family reverts to free tier**
3. **If owner upgrades, all members get new features**
4. **Transfer ownership** feature available
5. **Family can have co-owners** (both can manage billing)
