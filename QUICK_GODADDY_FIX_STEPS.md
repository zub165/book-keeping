# 🚨 QUICK FIX: GoDaddy Server Update

## **THE PROBLEM:**
- ✅ Frontend: Live on GitHub Pages
- ❌ Backend: GoDaddy server has OLD CODE
- 🚨 **500 Errors**: Family member creation failing
- 🚨 **Missing Features**: Email field, AI export/import

## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE SOLUTION:**

### **Step 1: Upload 6 Files to GoDaddy Server**

You need to upload these files to your GoDaddy server:

#### **Files to Upload:**
1. `backend/api/models.py` (with email field)
2. `backend/api/serializers.py` (updated serializer)
3. `backend/api/views.py` (with AI features)
4. `backend/api/urls.py` (with new endpoints)
5. `backend/requirements.txt` (with new packages)
6. `backend/api/migrations/0002_familymember_email_familymember_is_registered.py`

### **Step 2: SSH into GoDaddy Server**
```bash
ssh your-username@208.109.215.53
```

### **Step 3: Navigate to Django Project**
```bash
cd /path/to/your/django/project
# OR find your project directory
pm2 list
```

### **Step 4: Install New Dependencies**
```bash
pip install openpyxl>=3.1.0 pandas>=2.0.0 python-dateutil>=2.8.0
```

### **Step 5: Apply Database Migration**
```bash
python3 manage.py migrate
```

### **Step 6: Restart Django Server**
```bash
pm2 restart django-app
# OR
pm2 restart all
```

## 🔧 **ALTERNATIVE: Automated Deployment**

### **Option A: Use the Automated Script**
```bash
# Edit the script with your server details
nano deploy-backend-to-godaddy.sh
# Update SERVER_USER and DJANGO_PROJECT_PATH
# Run the script
./deploy-backend-to-godaddy.sh
```

### **Option B: Manual File Upload**
1. **GoDaddy File Manager**: Upload files via cPanel
2. **FTP Client**: Upload via FileZilla or similar
3. **Git**: If you have git access on server
